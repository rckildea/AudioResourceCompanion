<br/>ARC is currently a music library and audio player application for Android devices.  It is planned to be an application that focuses on features not focused on in many media players; mainly, a watch list of all recent releases from every artist in your library, lyric importing funtionality and display, and music video linking for songs with official videos.

# How to Use ARC

<br/>Currently, all that is needed to play your MP3 files is that they are stored in a "Music" directory in your phone's external storage.  If the files are located in that folder, they will be added to ARC and can be played by clicking on them.
