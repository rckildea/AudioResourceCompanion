# Audio Resource Companion (ARC)
ARC is currently a music library and audio player application for Android devices.  This program was being developed for a Foundations of Software Engineering class at UMKC and is now a personal project.  It is planned to be an application that focuses on features not focused on in many media players; mainly, a watch list of all recent releases from every artist in your library, lyric importing funtionality and display, and music video linking for songs with official videos.  It uses the Spotify SDK to achieve many of these features.

# How to Use ARC
Currently, all that is needed to play your MP3 files is that they are stored in a "Music" directory in your phone's external storage.  If the files are located in that folder, they will be added to ARC and can be played by clicking on them in the "Songs" section of your library.
